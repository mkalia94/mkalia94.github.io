I"F<p>Hi!</p>

<p>I will defend my PhD publicly at the University of Twente on July 14. I’m pleased that you intend to partake in the culmination of my 5 year journey towards a PhD. Would you like to attend the defence and pick up a copy of my thesis? Please do sign up below!</p>

<p>The defence will be followed by a drink and dinner afterwards, for which you can also RSVP below.</p>

<p>The thesis will be printed in the form of a book, with roughly 200 pages and a size of 17 x 24 cm. If you’d like me to personally give you the copy in the Netherlands, that is definitely possible. Else, you will receive a copy shipped directly to your residence, or place of work.</p>

<p>I request you to fill out your details in the Google form link below.</p>
