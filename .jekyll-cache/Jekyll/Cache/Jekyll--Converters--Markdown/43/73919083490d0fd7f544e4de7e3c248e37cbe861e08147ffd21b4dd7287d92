I"	<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher working with <a href="http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/peterkoltai/index.html">Péter Koltai</a> and <a href="https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~froyland/">Gary Froyland</a> on applying dynamical systems methods in the context of social dynamics and climate science.</p>

<p>I recently obtained my PhD under <a href="https://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~meijerhge/">Hil Meijer</a> titled ‘Data, models and transitions in computational neuroscience: bottom-up and top-down approaches’ at the University of Twente.</p>

<p>My interests lie in mathematical modeling in physical sciences, dynamical systems and its interaction with machine learning.</p>
