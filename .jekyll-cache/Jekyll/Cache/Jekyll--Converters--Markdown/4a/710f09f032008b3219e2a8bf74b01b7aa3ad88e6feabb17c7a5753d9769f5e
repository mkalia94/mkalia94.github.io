I"1<p>I am a researcher working in dynamical systems theory and its applications in neuroscience and machine learning. I obtained my PhD under <a href="https://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~meijerhge/">Hil Meijer</a> titled ‘Data, models and transitions in computational neuroscience: bottom-up and top-down approaches’ at the University of Twente.  Board games, racket sports and bouldering. Open sourced research and knowledge!</p>
