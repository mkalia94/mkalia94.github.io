I'm a PhD candidate in Applied Math at the University of Twente [(here)](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/sacs/research/projects/projectpage-Kalia/#description) working on bottom-up and top-down approaches in computational neuroscience. While AFK, I enjoy board games, racket sports and bouldering. Open sourced research and knowledge!
