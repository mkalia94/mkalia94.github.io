I am a postdoc working with [PÃ©ter Koltai](http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/peterkoltai/index.html) and [Gary Froyland](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~froyland/) at FU-Berlin. I recently obtained my PhD under [Hil Meijer](https://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~meijerhge/) titled 'Data, models and transitions in computational neuroscience: bottom-up and top-down approaches' at the University of Twente. 

**Research interests:**
- Nonlinear dynamical systems and bifurcation theory
- Computational neuroscience
- Machine learning and dynamical systems
- Network dynamics

**News**:
- 10/22 - 11/22: Visiting Gary Froyland at UNSW, Sydney
- 04/23: Biophysical neural masses and EEG! [Preprint here.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.07.535995v1)
