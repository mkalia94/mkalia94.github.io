I am a researcher working in dynamical systems theory and its applications in neuroscience and machine learning. I obtained my PhD under [Hil Meijer](https://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~meijerhge/) titled 'Data, models and transitions in computational neuroscience: bottom-up and top-down approaches' at the University of Twente.  Board games, racket sports and bouldering. Open sourced research and knowledge!

Starting August 1, I will start an Einstein Visting Fellowship postdoctoral position at the Freie Universit\"at Berlin, with [P\'eter Koltai](http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/peterkoltai/index.html) and [Gary Froyland](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~froyland/).
