I am a postdoctoral researcher working with [PÃ©ter Koltai](http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/peterkoltai/index.html) and [Gary Froyland](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~froyland/) on applying dynamical systems methods in the context of social dynamics and climate science.

I recently obtained my PhD under [Hil Meijer](https://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~meijerhge/) titled 'Data, models and transitions in computational neuroscience: bottom-up and top-down approaches' at the University of Twente. 

My interests lie in mathematical modeling in physical sciences, dynamical systems and its interaction with machine learning.
