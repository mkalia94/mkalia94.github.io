I'm a PhD candidate in Applied Math at the University of Twente [(here)](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/sacs/research/projects/projectpage-Kalia/#description) working on computational neuroscience, dynamical systems and machine learning. While AFK, I enjoy board games, racket sports and bouldering. Open sourced research and knowledge! **Currently looking for Postdoc/job options.**
