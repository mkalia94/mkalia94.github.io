## Code of conduct for Climb For Gaza

The Climb the wall program is not officially attached to our initiative. Their code of conduct is available [here](https://climb-the-wall.org/#code-of-conduct).

Climbing is for everyone. Our sessions will involve people of varying climbing experiences and backgrounds. The aim of this initiative is to climb together in reflection of our unconditional solidarity for Palestine and all emancipatory liberation movements. We do not tolerate expressions of homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism and ableism in any of the climb sessions. 

The sessions will start slow and introduce climbing and bouldering to those who are not yet aware. We will go through climbing and safety basics, before leaving the session open to explore the gym. The session leader will always have eyes on the participants for help and assistance.

If you experience discomfort due to anyone’s comments or actions, kindly let the session leader know. Unless otherwise stated, this person would be Manu. Do not hesitate to come talk about any form of discomfort you may have.

We request you to kindly be open to receiving criticism if you do happen to offend or harm someone unintentionally and it is brought to your attention. We aim to foster an inclusive space for people across the board to learn and support each other in our solidarity for a free Palestine and a permanent end to the genocide.

Kindly note that the gyms are generally unaware of the initiative. Given the nature of things in Berlin, there may be confrontations from gym goers or authorities. Kindly be aware of this, stay close to each other and inform the session leader if things go awry.

The fundraiser is to raise funds for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund .
