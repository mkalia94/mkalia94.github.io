 My research and interests are broadly divided over three categories:
1. **Generalizable computational neuroscience**: 
 + How can we build biophysically realistic models that are consistent across experimental conditions and pathologies? 
 + How can we scale models from single synapses to tissues to interacting brain regions? 
2. **Applied dynamical systems**: 
 + How do complex phenomena arising in physical systems relate to local/global bifurcation analysis of their governing equations? 
 + Can new bifurcations in such equations reveal more about the physical phenomenon in question?
3. **Machine learning and dynamical systems**: 
 + Moving away from traditional bottom-up approaches to construct feature-rich models based on physical principles, can we derive such feature-rich models from data alone? 
 + Further, can dynamical systems play a role in understanding/controling/stabilizing the current machine learning paradigm?
