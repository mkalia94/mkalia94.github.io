      <h2></h2>
      <h2 id="climb-for-gaza">Climb for Gaza!</h2>
<p>Greetings! We’re very glad you’re here. Throughout June 2025, <a href="https://climb-the-wall.org/">Climb the Wall</a>, a global climbing fundraiser for Palestine, aims to collectively reach a massive 768 km in vertical height - equal to the estimated length of the ‘Apartheid Walls’ Israel has built around and within the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza.</p>

<p>As far as we know, the Climb the Wall initiative has not impressed upon Berlin. The bouldering gyms are visually apathetic to the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Inspired, we plan to climb together in solidarity with the Palestinians and raise funds for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund <a href="https://www.pcrf.net/">(PCRF)</a>.</p>

<p>We will climb together for a week from June 11-17 and circle around 6 gyms in Berlin. We’ll wear sporty clothes clearly demonstrating our solidarity, be it through stickers and keychains to Palestine football shirts (that can be purchased in Sonnenallee for instance). Bring your merch! Also do contact us if you need to buy merch in terms of tshirts or tote bags, we have a quite a lot available.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-d8RXMtvUTZMfGZ9MxcMO8w_er61BaGtJHLQMhTXz63bJ1g/viewform?usp=dialog"><strong>Sign up here</strong></a></p>

<h3 id="the-session">The session</h3>
<p>We will meet together at the gym at the start of the session. You will be led for a minimum 2-hour climbing session with max 9 other folks, going all the way from stretching, bouldering basics and safety, to bouldering your way around the gym. The session leader will always have tabs on you. After, if others like, we could go together to get a bite or drink.</p>

<h3 id="costs">Costs</h3>
<p>Kindly note that all the boulder gyms that we will circle through are on Urban Sports Club. So if you have a membership for that, it’s free! If not, a day pass is around 14-15 euros, depending on the gym. Climbing shoes are necessary, and shoe rentals are usually a maximum of 5 euros on top.</p>

<p>We request a <strong>minimum 5 euro donation</strong> apart from the necessary charges for the bouldering gym. All of the proceeds from the donations will go to the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund. A receipt for the session’s donations will be duly provided on request.</p>
