	abstract = {Complex systems manifest a small number of instabilities and bifurcations that are canonical in nature, resulting in universal pattern forming characteristics as a function of some parametric dependence. Such parametric instabilities are mathematically characterized by their universal un-foldings, or normal form dynamics, whereby a parsimonious model can be used to represent the dynamics. Although center manifold theory guarantees the existence of such low-dimensional normal forms, finding them has remained a long standing challenge. In this work, we introduce deep learning autoencoders to discover coordinate transformations that capture the underlying parametric dependence of a dynamical system in terms of its canonical normal form, allowing for a simple representation of the parametric dependence and bifurcation structure. The autoencoder constrains the latent variable to adhere to a given normal form, thus allowing it to learn the appropriate coordinate transformation. We demonstrate the method on a number of example problems, showing that it can capture a diverse set of normal forms associated with Hopf, pitchfork, transcritical and/or saddle node bifurcations. This method shows how normal forms can be leveraged as canonical and universal building blocks in deep learning approaches for model discovery and reduced-order modeling.},

    abstract = {The anatomical and functional organization of neurons and astrocytes at ‘tripartite synapses’ is essential for reliable neurotransmission, which critically depends on ATP. In low energy conditions, synaptic transmission fails, accompanied by a breakdown of ion gradients, changes in membrane potentials and cell swelling. The resulting cellular damage and cell death are causal to the often devastating consequences of an ischemic stroke. The severity of ischemic damage depends on the age and the brain region in which a stroke occurs, but the reasons for this differential vulnerability are far from understood. In the present study, we address this question by developing a comprehensive biophysical model of a glutamatergic synapse to identify key determinants of synaptic failure during energy deprivation. Our model is based on fundamental biophysical principles, includes dynamics of the most relevant ions, i.e., Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl− and glutamate, and is calibrated with experimental data. It confirms the critical role of the Na+/K+-ATPase in maintaining ion gradients, membrane potentials and cell volumes. Our simulations demonstrate that the system exhibits two stable states, one physiological and one pathological. During energy deprivation, the physiological state may disappear, forcing a transit to the pathological state, which can be reverted when blocking voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels. Our model predicts that the transition to the pathological state is favoured if the extracellular space fraction is small. A reduction in the extracellular space volume fraction, as, e.g. observed with ageing, will thus promote the brain’s susceptibility to ischemic damage. Our work provides new insights into the brain’s ability to recover from energy deprivation, with translational relevance for diagnosis and treatment of ischemic strokes.},

	journal = {Nonlinearity},
	abstract = {A saddle to saddle-focus homoclinic transition when the stable leading eigenspace is three-dimensional (called the 3DL bifurcation) is analyzed. Here a pair of complex eigenvalues and a real eigenvalue exchange their position relative to the imaginary axis, giving rise to a 3D stable leading eigenspace at the critical parameter values. This transition is different from the standard Belyakov bifurcation, where a double real eigenvalue splits either into a pair of complex-conjugate eigenvalues or two distinct real eigenvalues. In the wild case, we obtain sets of codimension 1 and 2 bifurcation curves and points that asymptotically approach the 3DL bifurcation point and have a structure that differs from that of the standard Belyakov case. We give an example of this bifurcation in a perturbed Lorenz–Stenflo 4D ordinary differential equation model.},

    abstract = {    We analyze cross-correlation between runs scored over a time interval in cricket matches of different teams using methods of random matrix theory (RMT). We obtain an ensemble of cross-correlation matrices $$C$$$
from runs scored by eight cricket playing nations for (i) test cricket from 1877 -2014 
(ii)one-day internationals from
1971 -2014 and (iii) seven teams participating in the Indian Premier league T20 format (2008-2014) respectively.
We find that a majority of the eigenvalues of C fall within the bounds of random matrices having joint probability distribution $$$P(x_1\ldots,x_n)=C_{N \beta} \, \prod_{j<k}w(x_j)\left | x_j-x_k \right |^\beta$$$ where $$$w(x)=x^{N\beta a}\exp\left(-N\beta b x\right)$$$ and $$$\beta$$ is the Dyson parameter. The corresponding level density  gives Marchenko-Pastur (MP) distribution while fluctuations of every participating team agrees with the universal behavior of Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We analyze the components of the deviating eigenvalues and find that the largest eigenvalue corresponds
to an influence common to all matches played during these periods.},
